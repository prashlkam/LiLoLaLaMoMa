# LiLoLaLaMoMa
the Linux Local Large Language Models Manager - a GUI app to help users manage almost every aspect of LLMs Locally on Linux..... 
---------------------
## Overview.....
This project aims to be the Aggregation point for the Local Gen AI ecosystem. It would have the following Sections....

### 1. Init Section
A section containing a series of buttons / links - the aim here is to get the user Up and Running with Local Gen AI - as quickly and effortlessly as possible. Here we'll provide direct Installation links (as buttons) to the following...
- Ollama
- Open-webui
- AnythingLLM
- and some other tools

### 2. Models Section 
In this section - there will be Cards for every Model installed on the system. Further, there will be control buttons for each model - to do the following...

 - Run / Serve / Stop a Model
 - Pull / Remove a Model
 - Get Info about a model
 - Create a New Model
 - Push or Upload a Model
 
[all these options are available in Ollama - via the Command Line. Providing a set of buttons to do this - will only make the job much easier for the End User]

### 3. Config Section
The Config section will provide centralized access to the Config files of the various components. Initially, the individual config files can be opened in Vim - where the User can directly edit these files. At a later stage - a UI may be created and linked to the Config files - allowing users to edit the Config files via the UI. The following aspects could feature in this section...

 - Config options - Categorized by Component
 - Centralized UI for all Config options
 - Troubleshooters for Common issues 

### 4. RAG Section
RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation. There are many implementations of RAG - some work out-of-the-box, some don't. Also, if the LLM changes - RAG fails inevitably. So the goal here is to provide the users a consistant and failsafe RAG Experience. The following aspects could be covered...

 - RAG across various file types
 - Folder RAG - All supported docs in a folder are taken for RAG in 1 shot
 - Url RAG - allowing users to perform RAG directly on Websites (requires internet connection)
 - Failsafe RAG - Achieving a Consistant RAG - even when the Model Changes
 - reset RAG / clear RAG cache

### 5. Extensions Section
It'd be nice to here LiLoLaLaMoMa Extensions for some of the major Linux Desktops / Apps. Some of the more popular set of extensions could be...

 - Extensions for Libreoffice
 - Extensions for Nextcloud
 - Extensions for KDE Plasma, GNOME, MATE, Cinnamon and all other major Desktops
 - Extensions for some of the KDE Apps
 - A Custom Extensions Factory - Allowing users to create their own LiLoLaLaMoMa Extensions on the fly
 
### 6. Help Section
LiLoLaLaMoMa needs a comprahensive Help Section - covering the following...

 - User guides / docs for LiLoLaLaMoMa and all its various components
 - links to websites / github repos of all components
 - links to forums / user groups (including Social Media
 - links to videos / live streams etc.
 
[most of the docs in the Help section can be Generated using LiLoLaLaMoMa itself.]
